## Description
* The scene contains a simple city with buildings and a car.
* The car model was made in Blender and the city model was downloaded from cgtrader.com (links at the end).
* Cubemap textures were used for the sky.
* The animation is the car moving (forward, backward, turn left, turn right) which can be controlled with the arrow keys.
* The camera follows the car always. 
* It has directional and ambient lights, as well as shadows.
* The car collides with the buildings. 
* Built with WebGL's library three.js and cannon.js for physics.
